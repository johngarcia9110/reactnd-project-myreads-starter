# MyReads Project

The MyReads project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 
The project showcases React.js fundamentals I learned in the React.js Udacity course.

## To start the App:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
